        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected. Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke.</p>
   
        <p style="font-family: verdana"><h3><u>Symptoms:</u></h3>
    <img class="border" src="img/highsym.jpg" style="float:right;" width=350 height=300 hspace="100" alt="highsym">
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypertension does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms. When it does, you might experience dizziness, shortness of breath, headaches, and nosebleeds, which could indicate that your blood pressure is rising. Complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure can occur if long-term hypertension is not adequately treated. A hypertensive emergency, which is an uncommon and dangerous event, may cause blurry vision, nausea, chest pain and anxiety.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptoms that do occur, if present, may indicate temporary fluctuations or elevations in blood pressure, and can be related to the timing of medication doses. Generally, the symptoms of hypertension can happen at any time, do not last for long, and may recur. They include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p style="font-family:verdana"><h5>Recurrent headaches:</h5><p style="font-family: courier"> Headaches are fairly common among people with or without hypertension. Some people with hypertension notice changes or worsening of headaches when medications are skipped or when the blood pressure becomes higher than usual. Headaches associated with hypertension can be mild, moderate, or severe and can be of a throbbing nature. </p></li>
            <li><p style="font-family:verdana"><h5>Dizziness:</h5><p style="font-family: courier">People with hypertension may notice dizziness in relation to medication doses and blood pressure fluctuations. </p></li>
            <li><p style="font-family:verdana"><h5>Shortness of breath:</h5><p style="font-family: courier">Hypertension can cause shortness of breath as a result of the effect on the heart and lung function. Shortness of breath is more noticeable with physical exertion or exercise. </p></li>
            <li><p style="font-family:verdana"><h5>Nosebleed:</h5><p style="font-family: courier">You may be more prone to nosebleeds if you have hypertension, although, in general, nosebleeds are not a classic sign of high blood pressure.</p></li>
        </ul>    
    <br><center><p style="font-family: verdana"><h3>When to see a doctor?</h3></center>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll likely have your blood pressure taken as part of a routine doctor's appointment.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask your doctor for a blood pressure reading every year.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood pressure generally should be checked in both arms to determine if there's a difference. It's important to use an appropriate-sized arm cuff.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;Your doctor will likely recommend more frequent readings if you've already been diagnosed with high blood pressure or have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Children age 3 and older will usually have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't regularly see your doctor, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. You can also find machines in some stores that will measure your blood pressure for free.</p>
        <p style="font-family: courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;Public blood pressure machines, such as those found in pharmacies, may provide helpful information about your blood pressure, but they may have some limitations. The accuracy of these machines depends on several factors, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines. Ask your doctor for advice on using public blood pressure machines.</p>
